## Introduction

DataSight, created using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/), is an application designed to allow users to upload datasets in `xlsx`, or `csv` format. This application then converts the data into graphical visualizations and conducts statistical analysis.

## Instructions 

- Ensure your data is structured correctly for the app to interpret it. Refer to the "Example Files" folder in this GitHub repository for guidance.
- The application only accepts CSV and Excel files.
- Clean and pre-process your data before uploading it to the application.
- Select the appropriate visualization or statistical feature based on your data and analysis needs.
